Payment gateways process real-world donation receipts and register them with Smartlike network. Gateways are hosted by creators and publishers so that users could choose whom they trust their private data, in case their preffered payment method shares the data with recipients. Creators can authorize gateways hosted by other creators to process their receipts.

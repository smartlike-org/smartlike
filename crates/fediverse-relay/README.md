A Fediverse to Smartlike relay prototype.

Fediverse users receive micro-donations sent via Smartlike by [connecting](https://smartlike.org/docs/how-to-set-up-content-monetization) their Fediverse profiles to Smartlike accounts. They can also opt to have their Fediverse keys trusted on Smartlike to make donations or create subscriptions without leaving their Fediverse sites.
The relay forwards signed thumb-up/comment/boost transactions from connected users to Smartlike transparently turning them into micro-donations.
